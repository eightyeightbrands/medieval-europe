<b> How to contribute </b>

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project move forward.

Discussions for changes happen on the ME discord server as well as the site forums.  Items to be worked on will be streamlined there 
and turned over to a volunteer to work on. 

<b>Testing</b>

We are currently in the process of setting up a testing vps for people to use for testing before making a Pull Request. 

<b> Submitting changes </b>

Please send a GitHub Pull Request to eightyeightbrands with a clear list of what you've done (read more about pull requests in the Github tutorial). When you send a pull request please also include RSpec examples if you are able. To much test data is never a bad thing.
Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

<b>Coding conventions</b>

The code used for medieval-europe has been worked on over 10 years in Kohana.  Please be mindful of the code you use as to avoid conflicting codes.
